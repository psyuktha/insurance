# Machine Learning Regression Project

## Overview
This project is focused on building a Machine Learning regression model to predict insurance charges based on a dataset. The dataset used for this project is 'insurance.csv' and is sourced from [Medical Cost dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance) available from Kaggle and [on GitHub](https://github.com/stedy/Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets/blob/master/insurance.csv).
## Project Description
In this project, we will perform the following steps:

1. Data Collection: We will obtain the dataset from the provided URL.
2. Data Preprocessing: We will clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features as required.
3. Model Building: We will build a regression model using a machine learning algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
4. Model Training: The model will be trained on a portion of the dataset based on a number of different parameters such as, age, sex, bmi, children, smoking_status and residential_region.
5. Model Evaluation: We will evaluate the model's performance using appropriate regression metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error).
6. Deployment: The final model can be deployed for making predictions on new data.

## Project Files
- `insurance.csv`: The dataset used for this project.
- `Regression_Model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Libraries Used
- Python 3
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the 'Regression_Model.ipynb' notebook in Google Colab or a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Usage
1. Follow the steps in the 'Regression_Model.ipynb' notebook to run the project.
2. Modify the notebook to suit your specific needs, such as trying different regression algorithms or hyperparameter tuning.
